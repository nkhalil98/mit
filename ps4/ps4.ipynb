    "A hand is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The player is initially dealt a set of random letters. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: <code>a, q, l, m, u, i, l</code>. In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above hand would be represented as:\n",

    "Notice how the repeated letter <code>'l'</code> is represented. Remember that with a dictionary, the usual way to access a value is <code>hand['a']</code>, where <code>'a'</code> is the key we want to find. However, this only works if the key is in the dictionary; otherwise, we get a <code>KeyError</code>. To avoid this, we can use the call <code>hand.get('a',0)</code>. This is the \"safe\" way to access a value if we are not sure the key is in the dictionary. <code>d.get(key,default)</code> returns the value for <code>key</code> if <code>key</code> is in the dictionary <code>d</code>, else <code>default</code>. If <code>default</code> is not given, it returns <code>None</code>, so that this method never raises a <code>KeyError</code>. For example:\n",

Your task is to implement the function <code>updateHand</code>, which takes in two inputs - a <code>hand</code> and a <code>word</code> (string). <code>updateHand</code> uses letters from the hand to spell the word, and then returns a copy of the <code>hand</code>, containing only the letters remaining.
