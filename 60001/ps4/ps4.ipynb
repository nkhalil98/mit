    "**Please read this problem entirely!!** The majority of this problem consists of learning how to read code, which is an incredibly useful and important skill. At the end, you will implement a short function. Be sure to take your time on this problem - it may seem easy, but reading someone else's code can be challenging and this is an important exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing hands\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hand** is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The player is initially dealt a set of random letters. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: <code>a, q, l, m, u, i, l</code>. In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above hand would be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the repeated letter <code>'l'</code> is represented. Remember that with a dictionary, the usual way to access a value is <code>hand['a']</code>, where <code>'a'</code> is the key we want to find. However, this only works if the key is in the dictionary; otherwise, we get a <code>KeyError</code>. To avoid this, we can use the call <code>hand.get('a',0)</code>. This is the \"safe\" way to access a value if we are not sure the key is in the dictionary. <code>d.get(key,default)</code> returns the value for <code>key</code> if <code>key</code> is in the dictionary <code>d</code>, else <code>default</code>. If <code>default</code> is not given, it returns <code>None</code>, so that this method never raises a <code>KeyError</code>. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pyhton\n",
    ">>> hand['e']\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "KeyError: 'e'\n",
    ">>> hand.get('e', 0)\n",
    "0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting words into dictionary representation\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful function we've defined for you is <code>getFrequencyDict</code>, defined near the top of <code>ps4a.py</code>. When given a string of letters as an input, it returns a dictionary where the keys are letters and the values are the number of times that letter is represented in the input string. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> getFrequencyDict(\"hello\")\n",
    "{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this is the same kind of dictionary we use to represent hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying a hand\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a hand represented as a dictionary, we want to display it in a user-friendly way. We have provided the implementation for this in the <code>displayHand</code> function. Take a few minutes right now to read through this function carefully and understand what it does and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating a random hand\n",
    "\n",
    "The hand a player is dealt is a set of letters chosen at random. We provide you with the implementation of a function that generates this random hand, <code>dealHand</code>. The function takes as input a positive integer <code>n</code>, and returns a new object, a hand containing <code>n</code> lowercase letters. Again, take a few minutes (right now!) to read through this function carefully and understand what it does and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing letters from a hand (you implement this)\n",
    "\n",
    "The player starts with a hand, a set of letters. As the player spells out words, letters from this set are used up. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: <code>a, q, l, m, u, i, l</code>. The player could choose to spell the word <code>quail</code>. This would leave the following letters in the player's hand: <code>l, m</code>. Your task is to implement the function <code>updateHand</code>, which takes in two inputs - a <code>hand</code> and a <code>word</code> (string). <code>updateHand</code> uses letters from the hand to spell the word, and then returns a copy of the <code>hand</code>, containing only the letters remaining. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}\n",
    ">>> displayHand(hand) # Implemented for you\n",
    "a q l l m u i\n",
    ">>> hand = updateHand(hand, 'quail') # You implement this function!\n",
    ">>> hand\n",
    "{'a':0, 'q':0, 'l':1, 'm':1, 'u':0, 'i':0}\n",
    ">>> displayHand(hand)\n",
    "l m\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the <code>updateHand</code> function. Make sure this function has no side effects: i.e., it must not mutate the hand passed in. Before pasting your function definition here, be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in <code>test_ps4a.py</code>.\n",
